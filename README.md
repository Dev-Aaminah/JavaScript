# JavaScript Practice Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript practice repository! This repository contains the code files and projects I am working on as I learn and practice JavaScript. As a beginner, I am using this space to track my progress, experiment with different concepts, and build a portfolio of my work.

## Contents

- **Basic Syntax and Operators:** Simple scripts covering variables, data types, operators, and basic functions.
- **Control Structures:** Practice with if-else statements, loops, and switch cases.
- **Functions and Scope:** Examples of function declarations, expressions, and the scope of variables.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Projects involving manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM).
- **Events:** Handling user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Introduction to callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- **Projects:** Small projects and exercises to apply the concepts learned.

## Goals

- To understand and practice core JavaScript concepts.
- To build a solid foundation for more advanced JavaScript topics.
- To create a reference of my learning journey that can help others.

Feel free to explore the files and provide feedback or suggestions. Happy coding!
